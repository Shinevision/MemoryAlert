# MemoryAlert
MemoryAlert is a small program that monitors your memory usage and alerts you if it gets too high, avoiding extreme lagging when a computer hits 100% or sometimes even lower.

Sometimes this can make systems freeze and have a very high response time (like having 1 FPS in a game)
usally caused by the system trying to write the memory to disk (Especially if you have an HDD instead of an SSD).

Or your memory is actually 100% and in that cause, lots can go wrong.
